Game submission for gitcoin

You have heard about cookie clicker? Probably yes, is an adictive click game in which you click to earn cookies. Sadly that game has a couple of problems that the blockchain can solve for this game, one, hability to spend paid content to improve your progress, then a method to guarantee all your achievements in a secure form.

With a fun "story" to click into ;) and all of this blockchain facilities this can be a fun great game that will get the world of oasis network closer to most gamers who likes clicker games.

By the moment we are a team of 3, one artist and 2 c++ developers, this game concept was going to be developed and released by october, but, with this hackaton, we 3 agreed to work more and deliver all the requirements within this 3 months.

From today to the June 29, we will work on the functional aspect of the game, getting the bare minimun for this to be played, then as the artist starts finishing assets tose will be added within 3 months. For the last month trials on the testnet should be done to ensure the correct use of the blockchain behind. For us as developers there is a lot to learn and we think that this technology is better than the traditional payment methods!

After this, wether if we win or not, we plan to launch the game in steam for free, and get the rewards from the purchases made in the blockchain, either by NFTs of special pizzas or to buy upgrades with tokens, just like other clicker games do, like clicker heroes.

The project is structured as follows:

MetaCoin -> Will contain the smart contracts that will be deployed on Emerald parachain.

RustConnector -> A library that uses rust's web3 library to connect and operate the Emerald parachain.

Source -> The Unreal Engine 5 C++ Code. All game logic and calls to the libraries. Since the assets are over 6GB those cannot be uploaded here. The blueprints part are only intended to be used to instantiate the C++ classes in game and will not contain significant logic.
